- Orange instead of blue?
- Test in other browsers.
- Make the progress bar work without -webkit-... stuff.
- Make the viewport 1024px wide when the iPad is in landscape orientation.

- No 'Load moreâ€¦' at the bottom; ?before=[timestamp] for now. Maybe we should have separate page(s) with abbreviated per-room result 'logs'?
- Use a countdown attribute on the class instead of using the real time so the bar updates more cleanly (if slightly incorrect)?
- Title attribute with timestamp for each row?
