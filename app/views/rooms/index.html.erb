<h1>Room Temperature</h1>

<p>Here’s a fun little thing we’ve been working on. It’s not done, but we wanted you to play with it anyway.</p>
<p>It’s all pretty simple. Use the stars to rate whatever is going on right now. There’s a progress bar to tell you how much time you have left to make up your mind.</p>
<p>Your vote gets added up with those from others in your room, showing you how great a time you’re all having. Or not. ;)</p>
<p>We only have a few rooms right now. When we’re done you may be able to create your own, but this will have to do for now.</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>
